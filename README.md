# (WIP) Edsger Library x86/64 (Linux & Mac)

This is an x86/64 library for Edsger Programming Language. This lib is a fork of this
repo: /abenetopoulos/edsger\_lib but it follows a stack oriented approach instead. If
you are using the standard calling convention, passing arguments through a stack, you 
should stick to the original repo.

## How To Compile

    make

## Functions implemented so far

    readString  : stack int, stack char* -> -
    writeString : stack char* -> -

# Edsger Library x86/64 (Linux & Mac)

This is an x86/64 library for Edsger Programming Language. This lib "forks" parts
that don't need to change from this repo: /abenetopoulos/edsger\_lib since the purpose
is the same, but the Calling Convention that this repo will implement follows a stack
oriented approach.

## How To Compile

coming soon

## Functions implemented so far

    readString  : stack int, stack char\* -> -
    writeString : stack char\* -> -
